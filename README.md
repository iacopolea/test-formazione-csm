## Introduction
Is it weird that a C.E.O. can be considered up-and-coming?
Yes, but of course everything about the new nearly normal is weird, and Wiener is a droll yet gentle guide.
Divided into two parts — *Incentives* and *Scale* — *Uncanny Valley* begins across the country, where 25-year-old Wiener is a low-paid assistant at a small New York literary agency, *“oblivious to Silicon Valley, and contentedly so.”*

> I did not know that it was nearly impossible to use the internet at all without enriching the online superstore or its founder,
> I only knew that I was expected to loathe both, and I did — loudly, at any opportunity, and with righteous indignation.

An article about an ebook start-up in New York attracted her interest. She interviewed for a job, and was hired in early 2013. It wasn’t a good fit and she was soon fired.
But Wiener had caught the bug. She landed a job as a customer-service associate at a thriving start-up in San Francisco that made a data-analysis tool.
It was the hottest of products in an era when ever more finely articulated data about consumers had emerged as the most valuable commodity of all.

> In publishing, Wiener writes, “nobody my age was excited about what might come next. Tech, by comparison, promised … a future.”

After nearly two years of being “Down for the Cause”—as the young CEO demanded—she began to wonder about the psychological and social effects of tech, yet continued to drift through the Valley.


## The Book
### Summary
The book details Wiener's decision to quit her job as a freelance copy editor and literary agency assistant in New York in order to move to Silicon Valley in San Francisco.
Wiener, who felt restricted by the publishing industry's restrictive norms and shrinking revenue, feels out of place amongst the tech executives and engineers in her new surroundings yet content with her rising wage and generous work benefits.
After switching between several companies, she finally settles on the open-source coding company GitHub as a customer service representative.
Despite the demeaning nature of her work and the stressful nature of investigating potentially inflammatory or illegal posts on the site, she decides to remain due to the company's various perks, such as being able to work from home.
Throughout the book, Wiener ruminates about the moral implications of data collection and manipulation amongst technology firms.

### The Author
![alt text](https://www.corriere.it/methode_image/2021/01/03/Cultura/Foto%20Cultura%20-%20Trattate/anna%20wiener-kcpG-U323013176918016MI-656x492@Corriere-Web-Sezioni.jpg)
Wiener, who grew up in Brooklyn, attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT. After college, she moved to New York before later moving to San Francisco.[^1]
She chose to work in the tech sector in an attempt to find a career path with more "momentum" than the book publishing industry, where she was previously employed.
Wiener was likewise deeply interested in data, particularly the way in which it could be used to tell stories. In San Francisco, she ended up working for an analytics startup and GitHub, and befriending Stripe CEO Patrick Collison.
Her book, Uncanny Valley, never mentions the names of the companies she worked at or interacted with, though she often describes their products and corporate cultures in sufficient detail for the reader to deduce what they are.
After several years in San Francisco, she chose to leave the tech industry for several reasons, including its lack of response to the classified information released by Edward Snowden and a wider disillusionment with the corporate culture and sexism present therein.
Since leaving tech, Wiener has been writing about Silicon Valley for The New Republic, n+1, Atlantic, and others. She is a contributing writer to the New Yorker.
